> Inez Pittoors (21) is a third year student of studio printmaking. Her artistic practice consists of easy moveable objects wich become complete installations. Itâ€™s the independence of modern nomads that intrigues her. She uses natural materials such as reed, wooden branches and so on. Her work invites you to slow down and to connect with your body and the environment. She questions the rat race society. The beauty of nature and the simplicity of life (in nature) surprises her again and again.
