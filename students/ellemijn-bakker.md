Ellemijn Bakker is a 21 year old painting student, who often works around themes such as mental healt, psychological disorders and elements used in therapy. 

The core of her works are often her own feelings, using painting as a therapeutic process as a path to healing and recovery. 

From focusing on trauma and depression, to healing physically and mentally, to feeling safe and intomate. All of these topics are adressed in several series of paintings that switch from dark tones to light and bright colors. 

Ellemijn also often combines her drawings and paintings with self-written texts and poems to reinforce these sinsitive themes.
