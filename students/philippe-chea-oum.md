Philippe CHEA OUM age 23 - Marseille

He is a painter mixing painting and illustration, through his figurative painting, he creates spaces of narration inspired by the daily life. Allowing spectators to cling to objects and places they know and finally find a detail that disturbs this idea of reality. Appropriating their own universe is both comic and satyric. It plays with the ambiguity of reality and fiction, which leads to questions about the different scenes and the links between them. Using the popular codes of comics, which could be similar to boxes, are actually portals opening onto new spaces.

These portals are openings to the narrative, the association of images show that the meaning of reading does not matter. Everyone is free to interpret in the sense that he wants these paintings. We seek the beginning and the end as if to imagine a story, an adventure capable of titillating the imagination of everyone.
