Luciana Wolfarth (° 1998 Porto Alegre, Brazil) Based in Antwerp

To grasp her own reality –surrounding migration and the conventional idea of having an identity-and make sense of it she seeks a feeling of control over situations and emotions that are uncontrollable. This is done by using found metal structures and objects that are manipulated into different scenarios or forms aside with old photographs of her own distant relatives dated from the 19th century.  Along with this, she has the constant referral to the circus, which she does by explicitly using a distinctive naïve colour palette. The circus being on many levels her main world of inspiration, visually, ideologically and intellectually.  

At heart her inner child is still dominant and possessive of her artistic practice where she is continuously attempting to redirect emotion, feelings of nostalgia and displacement into a new kind of imaginary dimension in the pursuit of purpose and a sense of a feeling of a home.
