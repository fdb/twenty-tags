Vural (22) is a queer artist with Turkish roots. They study painting, but also like to experiment with different mediums. With a passion for the delfimage and identity, the selfportrait is a re-occurring theme in their work.\
Modt of the times the faces aren’t recognizable anymore, since it’s the inside that they’re trying to project.\
Just like their work, Vural has no filter.\
