Natalia Semiachkina        (°1995)\
\
\
In her work Natalia Semiachkina examines the fragile construction of in-between identities. As a child she immigrated from Russia to Belgium, so she grew up between two cultures. Her works embody the thorny search for a place to call home. Natalia learned to sew and embroider at a young age. She uses these traditional techniques, which are passed on from mother to daughter, in a contemporary way to tell her story. Natalia finds inspiration in Soviet architecture, digital archive images and old photographs of precious memories. “I tend to dive into the past, to see how I can move forward.” This confrontation between past and present evokes feelings of nostalgia and a deep longing for a place that only exists in memory.
