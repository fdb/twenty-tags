Yasmine Akondo (°2000)  Arendonk/Antwerp

In her work, she is looking for a beacon of peace in our hectic lives where we often forget that our existence is the only thing that really matters.  All our political, economic, educational, ... systems are just imposed structures that are no necessities to live. Therefor she tries to return to the essence of life, to rest and meditation, the earthly and the heavenly and studies  this in various cultures. In this upcoming expo she will translate this in a trip teak of movement, sound and matter.
