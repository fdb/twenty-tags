Kyra Van lent is a painter. She’s 19 and works with subjects like identity, sexuality and the self portrait. Despite finding it hard to open up in daily life, she can easily start a conversation with the spectator in her paintings. Sexuality is a big part of identity and this is shown in Kyra’s work, naked bodies and intense looks are common. The reworking of her paintings is also very important, examining an older painting to see it in a new perspective.

Besides paintings she also makes a lot of drawings. The quickness of her portrait drawings makes for a bigger amount of drawings and a more chaotic feeling. 

She wants to place a reflection on herself within herself and wants to show how a physical place can reflect a mental state.
