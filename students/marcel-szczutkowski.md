Marcel Szczutkowski is a 21 year old Queer Artist. He works mostly around his identity and is still searching for the real meaning of it through his artistic course. His favorite mediums to work with are video, photography and installations. Themes that are permanent are nudity, body, sex, and queer aesthetics. Marcel uses dark humor and sarcasm in his art to cope with the problems and struggles. His main goal is to interact with the public, shock them and teach people about the aesthetics they’re often not used to. Everything is very personal and showcases his feelings and expieriences as a young queer person.
